Nina, I need to finalize a trade on GBP/USD. What’s your current offer?

Hi Mark, for GBP/USD, I’m currently offering 1.3850. How much are you looking to trade?

FX Trader 1 (Mark):

I’m looking to trade $5 million, but 1.3850 is a bit high for me. Can you provide a better rate?

FX Trader 2 (Nina):

For $5 million, I can offer you 1.3800. The market’s been pretty volatile, so this is a solid rate.

FX Trader 1 (Mark):

1.3800 is an improvement, but I was hoping for something even better. How about 1.3780?

FX Trader 2 (Nina):
3:35 PM
1.3780 is quite low, Mark. I can go down to 1.3790. That’s the best I can do.

FX Trader 1 (Mark):

1.3790 works for me. Let’s confirm $5 million at 1.3790. Please proceed with the documentation.

FX Trader 2 (Nina):

Confirmed. I’ll get the paperwork to you right away. Usual settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader 1 (Mark):

Yes, T+2 is fine. Thanks for your help, Nina. Looking forward to a smooth transaction.

No problem, Mark. Everything will be sorted out on my end. We’ll handle it efficiently.
