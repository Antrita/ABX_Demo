Hello Julia, need a quote for USD/CHF. What’s your current rate?

Bank Trader (Julia):

Hi Oliver! I’m quoting 0.9160 for USD/CHF today. What amount are you considering?

FX Trader (Oliver):
3:47 PM
I’m looking to trade $1.5 million, but 0.9160 is a bit high. Can you provide a better rate?

Bank Trader (Julia):

For $1.5 million, I could offer 0.9145. The market’s been pretty stable today.

FX Trader (Oliver):

0.9145 is closer, but I was aiming for 0.9140. Can you meet that rate?

Bank Trader (Julia):
3:50 PM
0.9140 is a bit lower than I can go. The best I can do is 0.9142. That’s my final offer.

FX Trader (Oliver):
3:51 PM
Alright, 0.9142 it is. Let’s finalize $1.5 million at 0.9142. Please start the paperwork.

Bank Trader (Julia):

Confirmed. I’ll get the documents prepared and sent over. Usual settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader (Oliver):

Yes, T+2 is perfect. Thanks for the adjustment, Julia. Looking forward to a smooth transaction.
