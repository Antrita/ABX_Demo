Jake, I need to execute a trade on GBP/CHF. What’s your rate?

FX Trader 2 (Jake):

Hi Rachel, the rate for GBP/CHF is 1.2115. How much are you looking to trade?

FX Trader 1 (Rachel):

I’m planning on $2.5 million, but 1.2115 seems a bit high. Can you offer a better rate?

FX Trader 2 (Jake):

For $2.5 million, the best rate I can offer is 1.2100. The market conditions are quite challenging today.

FX Trader 1 (Rachel):

1.2100 is better, but I was hoping for 1.2080. Can you meet that?

FX Trader 2 (Jake):
1:05 PM
1.2080 is quite low. The most I can offer is 1.2090. That’s the lowest I can go.

FX Trader 1 (Rachel):

Alright, 1.2090 it is. Let’s confirm $2.5 million at 1.2090. Please start the paperwork.

FX Trader 2 (Jake):

Confirmed. I’ll prepare and send the documentation right away. Usual settlement, T+2?

FX Trader 1 (Rachel):

Yes, T+2 works. Thanks for the adjustment, Jake. Looking forward to a smooth transaction.
