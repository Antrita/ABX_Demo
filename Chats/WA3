Alex, I need to execute a transaction on AUD/CAD. What’s your rate today?

FX Trader 2 (Alex):

Hi Sophie, I’m offering 0.9340 for AUD/CAD. How much are you planning to trade?

FX Trader 1 (Sophie):
4:47 PM
I’m looking at $1 million. 0.9340 seems a bit steep. Can you offer a better rate?

FX Trader 2 (Alex):

For $1 million, the best I can offer is 0.9300. The market is quite tight right now.

FX Trader 1 (Sophie):

0.9300 is closer to what I need, but can you do 0.9280?

FX Trader 2 (Alex):
4:50 PM
0.9280 is lower than I can go. The most I can stretch to is 0.9290. That’s my final offer.

FX Trader 1 (Sophie):

Alright, 0.9290 works. Let’s lock it in for $1 million at 0.9290. Please get the paperwork started.

FX Trader 2 (Alex):

Deal. I’ll send over the documents shortly. Standard settlement, T+2?

FX Trader 1 (Sophie):

Yes, T+2 is good. Thanks for the quick adjustment, Alex. Looking forward to finalizing this.

You got it, Sophie. Everything will be arranged promptly.
