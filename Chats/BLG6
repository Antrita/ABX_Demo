Hello Mia, need a quote for NZD/GBP. What’s your rate?

Hi James! I’m quoting 0.5150 for NZD/GBP. How much are you thinking of trading?

FX Trader (James):
12:03 PM
I’m looking to trade $1.8 million. 0.5150 seems a bit high. Can you offer something better?

Bank Trader (Mia):
12:04 PM
For $1.8 million, I can offer 0.5135. The market’s been pretty active.

FX Trader (James):
12:06 PM
0.5135 is closer, but I was hoping for around 0.5125. Can you meet that rate?

Bank Trader (Mia):
12:07 PM
0.5125 is quite low. The best I can do is 0.5130. That’s the best I can offer right now.

FX Trader (James):
12:08 PM
Alright, 0.5130 works. Let’s finalize $1.8 million at 0.5130. Please start the paperwork.

Bank Trader (Mia):

Confirmed. I’ll prepare and send the documentation shortly. Usual settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader (James):

Yes, T+2 is fine. Thanks for your flexibility, Mia. Looking forward to a smooth transaction.
