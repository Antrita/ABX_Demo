Hi Ben, I need a quote on EUR/CHF. What’s the best rate you can offer?

Bank Trader (Ben):

Hello Sophia! For EUR/CHF, I’m quoting 0.9790. What’s your trade size?

FX Trader (Sophia):

I’m looking to trade $4 million, but 0.9790 is a bit high. Can you provide a better rate?

Bank Trader (Ben):

For $4 million, I could offer 0.9775. The market’s been quite volatile today.

FX Trader (Sophia):

0.9775 is closer, but I was hoping for 0.9760. Can you meet that?

Bank Trader (Ben):

0.9760 is quite low. I can offer 0.9770. That’s the best I can do.

FX Trader (Sophia):

Alright, 0.9770 it is. Let’s lock it in for $4 million at 0.9770. Please start the paperwork.

Bank Trader (Ben):

Confirmed. I’ll get the documents ready and send them over. Usual settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader (Sophia):

Yes, T+2 is perfect. Thanks for working with me, Ben. Looking forward to completing this.
