Hi Mark, can you give me a quote on CAD/JPY? Looking to make a trade.

Bank Trader (Mark):

Morning Anna! For CAD/JPY, I’m offering 110.40. What’s the trade size?

FX Trader (Anna):
9:14 AM
I’m aiming for $2 million. 110.40 seems a bit high. Can you adjust?

Bank Trader (Mark):
9:15 AM
For $2 million, I can offer 110.25. It’s a bit tighter today due to market volatility.

FX Trader (Anna):
9:17 AM
110.25 is closer, but I was hoping for 110.10. Can you meet that?

Bank Trader (Mark):
9:18 AM
110.10 is lower than I’m comfortable with. The best I can do is 110.15. That’s my final rate.

FX Trader (Anna):
9:19 AM
Alright, 110.15 works for me. Let’s lock it in for $2 million at 110.15. Please proceed with the paperwork.

Bank Trader (Mark):

Deal. I’ll get the documentation ready and send it over. Usual settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader (Anna):
9:21 AM
Yes, T+2 is fine. Thanks for the adjustment, Mark. Looking forward to completing this.

You’re welcome, Anna. Everything will be processed on time. Talk soon.
