Hey Raj, how's it going?
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:03 AM*
Hey John! Doing well, thanks. Busy morning so far. How about you?
**MSB Trader (John):**
*10:04 AM*
Same here, markets are a bit choppy today. I’m looking to get a quote on USD/INR, thinking of doing a trade. What’s your offer?
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:05 AM*
Yeah, it’s been a bit volatile. We can do 82.15 for USD/INR. How much are you looking to trade?
**MSB Trader (John):**
*10:06 AM*
Looking to move about $5 million. Your offer’s a bit high, though. I was hoping for something closer to 82.10.
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:07 AM*
$5 million, got it. 82.10’s a tough ask right now with the way the market's moving. I could do 82.13, but that’s the best I can offer.
**MSB Trader (John):**
*10:08 AM*
I get it, it’s a tricky market today. But 82.13 is still a bit higher than I’d like. How about meeting me halfway at 82.12?
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:09 AM*
You drive a hard bargain, John! 82.12 it is. Let's lock it in for $5 million.
**MSB Trader (John):**
*10:10 AM*
Great, appreciate it, Raj. Let's book it at 82.12 for $5 million. Settlement on usual terms?
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:11 AM*
Sounds good. Yes, usual terms, T+2. I’ll send you the confirmation shortly.
**MSB Trader (John):**
*10:12 AM*
Perfect, thanks Raj. Pleasure as always.
**Local Bank Trader (Raj):**
*10:12 AM*
Likewise, John. Take care!
