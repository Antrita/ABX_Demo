Lara, I need to execute a trade on AUD/USD. What’s your current rate?

FX Trader 2 (Lara):

Good morning, John. For AUD/USD, I’m offering 0.6745. What’s the size of your trade?

FX Trader 1 (John):
10:07 AM
I’m aiming to trade $4 million, but 0.6745 doesn’t quite work for me. Can you offer a better rate?

FX Trader 2 (Lara):

For $4 million, the best I can do is 0.6720. The market’s been quite volatile lately.

FX Trader 1 (John):

0.6720 is an improvement, but I was hoping for something better. Can you go down to 0.6700?

FX Trader 2 (Lara):
10:10 AM
0.6700 is a bit lower than I can manage. The best I can offer is 0.6710. That’s really stretching it.

FX Trader 1 (John):
10:11 AM
Alright, 0.6710 works. Let’s lock it in for $4 million at that rate. Please start the paperwork.

FX Trader 2 (Lara):
10:12 AM
Confirmed. I’ll prepare the documents and send them to you shortly. Standard T+2 settlement?

FX Trader 1 (John):
10:13 AM
Yes, T+2 is perfect. Thanks for working with me on this, Lara. Looking forward to a smooth process.

You bet, John. Everything will be arranged promptly. We’ll get it done.
