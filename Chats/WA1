Hi James, I need to execute a trade on EUR/JPY. What’s your current rate?

FX Trader 2 (James):

Hey Ella, I’m quoting 142.30 for EUR/JPY today. How much are you looking to trade?

FX Trader 1 (Ella):

I’m considering $2 million worth of EUR/JPY, but 142.30 isn’t quite good enough. Can you do better?

FX Trader 2 (James):

$2 million is substantial. Ella, given the current market conditions, 142.30 is quite competitive. I could go as low as 142.10 if that helps.

FX Trader 1 (Ella):

142.10 is closer, but I was hoping for a bit more flexibility. How about 142 flat? That’s my final offer.

FX Trader 2 (James):
2:20 PM
142 is pretty tight, Ella. The best I can do is 142.05. That’s pushing it on my end.

FX Trader 1 (Ella):
2:21 PM
142.05 sounds workable. Alright, let’s finalize at 142.05 for $2 million. Please start the necessary paperwork.

Great! I’ll send over the documentation shortly. Standard settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader 1 (Ella):
2:23 PM
Yes, T+2 is perfect. Thanks for your flexibility, James. Let’s get this settled smoothly.

FX Trader 2 (James):

Absolutely, Ella. All set for T+2. I’ll ensure everything is processed promptly.
