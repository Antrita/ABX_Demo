Hi Alex, hope you’re well today.

Hey Emily! I’m good, thanks. It’s a busy day on my end. What’s up?

FX Trader (Emily):

Same here, the market’s been quite active. I’m looking to get a quote on EUR/USD. What’s your rate?

Bank Trader (Alex):
11:18 AM
It’s been a bit volatile. I can offer you 1.0880 for EUR/USD. How much are you planning to trade?

FX Trader (Emily):
11:19 AM
I’m looking to move around $2 million. 1.0880 is a bit higher than I expected. Can you come down a bit?

Bank Trader (Alex):
11:20 AM
For $2 million, I could stretch to 1.0865. The market’s pretty tight right now, though.

FX Trader (Emily):
11:21 AM
1.0865 is closer, but I was hoping for something around 1.0850. Can you meet me there?

Bank Trader (Alex):
11:22 AM
1.0850 is quite a bit lower than I can go. The best I can do is 1.0860. That’s as far as I can stretch.

FX Trader (Emily):
11:23 AM
Alright, 1.0860 works. Let’s finalize it for $2 million at 1.0860. Please start the paperwork.

Bank Trader (Alex):
11:24 AM
Confirmed. I’ll prepare the documentation and send it over shortly. Standard settlement terms, T+2?

FX Trader (Emily):
11:25 AM
Yes, T+2 is fine. Thanks for accommodating, Alex. Looking forward to finalizing this.

You got it, Emily. Everything will be processed promptly. Talk soon.
