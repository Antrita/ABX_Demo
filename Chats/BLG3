Hi Lisa, hope you’re doing well. Need a quote on GBP/JPY.

Hey Daniel! I’m doing well, thanks. The market’s been pretty busy. I’m quoting 150.25 for GBP/JPY. How much are you looking to trade?

FX Trader (Daniel):
2:32 PM
I’m looking to trade $3 million, but 150.25 is a bit steep. Can you offer a better rate?

Bank Trader (Lisa):
2:33 PM
For $3 million, the best I can offer is 150.10. The market’s quite active, so that’s a good rate right now.

FX Trader (Daniel):
2:34 PM
150.10 is an improvement, but I was hoping for 150.00. Can you meet that?

Bank Trader (Lisa):
2:35 PM
150.00 is quite low. The most I can do is 150.05. That’s my final offer.

FX Trader (Daniel):
2:36 PM
Alright, 150.05 it is. Let’s lock it in for $3 million at 150.05. Please get the paperwork started.

Bank Trader (Lisa):
2:37 PM
Confirmed. I’ll get the documentation ready and send it over soon. Usual settlement, T+2?

FX Trader (Daniel):
2:38 PM
Yes, T+2 works. Thanks for the quick response, Lisa. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
