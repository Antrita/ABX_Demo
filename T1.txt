Chinedu, need to move on USD/NGN. What’s your rate?
**FX Trader 2 (Chinedu):**
*4:21 PM*
Kemi, good to hear from you. I can offer 775.50. How much are you looking to trade?
**FX Trader 1 (Kemi):**
*4:22 PM*
Looking to push through $3 million. But 775.50 isn’t going to work. I need better.
**FX Trader 2 (Chinedu):**
*4:23 PM*
$3 million, okay. But Kemi, the market’s tight right now. 775.50 is competitive. How about 775 flat? That’s me squeezing it.

Chinedu, you and I both know there’s some room to maneuver here. 774.80, and I’ll confirm it right now.
**FX Trader 2 (Chinedu):**
*4:25 PM*
774.80 is below where I’m comfortable, Kemi. Best I can stretch to is 774.90. That’s final.
**FX Trader 1 (Kemi):**
*4:26 PM*
774.90, huh? Alright, you’ve got a deal. Let’s lock it in for $3 million at 774.90. Get the paperwork sorted ASAP.
**FX Trader 2 (Chinedu):**
*4:27 PM*
Done. I’ll have everything over to you within the hour. Usual settlement, T+2?
**FX Trader 1 (Kemi):**
*4:28 PM*
Yes, T+2. Appreciate the quick turnaround, Chinedu. Let’s make this smooth.
**FX Trader 2 (Chinedu):**
*4:29 PM*
You got it, Kemi. We’ll get it done.
